<br>
<p>
  I joined IBM Research Australia as a Postdoc Research Scientist in May of 2015.
</p>
<p>
  I received my dual PhD degree (Machine Learning and Data Mining) at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia and Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China in 2015.
</p>
<p>
  My PhD research focused on making sense of big data with effective and agile data analytics. I’ve built a data mining framework leveraging advanced hashing algorithms to efficiently process massive data without changing the nature of the data much. This research has provided state-of-the-art technologies in big data processing and has a strong impact on data utilisation for social and economic benefits.
</p>
<p>
  In 2016, I was named among the top 200 of the most qualified young researchers globally, as part of the Heidelberg Laureate Forum, which brings together the winners of the most prestigious scientific awards. Meanwhile, I received the Romberg Grant Award from the University of Heidelberg in support and cooperation with the Heidelberg Laureate Forum.
</p>
<p>
  In 2017, I was selected as one of 100 outstanding Young Global Changers to represent Australia to attend the Think 20 Summit – GLOBAL SOLUTIONS. The Think 20 are mandated by the 2017 German presidency of the Group of Twenty (G20). The G20 think tank network (T20) is called upon to identify and collect the most relevant insights from the world’s leading think tanks to provide research-based solution proposals. The summit addresses key global issues such as financial resilience, sustainable development, migration, climate change and digitalisation.
</p>
<p>
  My current work focuses on cognitive data analytics, in particular on Watson education, big data analysis in social media and correlation analysis between events and time series.
